NEWS WEB APP:


My project is this "News" web app. As I have a fondness and habit of reading the news I usually have alot of tabs on computer on different news sites. As one can imagine it takes significant time to always open and close news tabs constantly and input my preferred sites and country news.
Therefore I took this porject as a chance to make a news aggregator web app! 
This app made me work more closely with API's than the other mail project and made me learn first hand how to specifically present the news I want exactly in the format I want and shape etc. So not only did it extend my knowledge of API's it also challenged my CSS and HTML and even Python knowledge. My programming knowledge and programmatic thinking increased through this project and it is for that reason why I know my project did indeed satisfy all the requirements.

HOW TO RUN: through the " python manage.py runserver " like all the other django based projects.

FILE CONTENTS:
news.sqlite3 = Database forlogin info
models.py = Has relevant models for the application
views.py = has all my main functions for the application
urls.py = connects DOM links to the views.py
main.css = All my css styles are in this file
main.js = my javascript file with a specific relevant function for the application.(too big for inline in HTML file)

HTML TEMPLATES:
index.html = main homepage once logged in.
login.html = login page if you have not already registered
register.html = register page if you do not already have any login info
news.html = main page for my more regional news
news_technology.html = main page for my regional news on tech
news_politics.html = main page for my regional news on politics
news_business.html = main page for my regional news on business
